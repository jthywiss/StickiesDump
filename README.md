# StickiesDump

This is a quick hack I put together to extract notes from the old macOS Stickies app, for import to the Notes app.

It includes Matthew Russell's Stickies Document class from his "Inside Stickies" article on macdevcenter.  (Thanks, Matthew!)  Matthew's code, in turn, uses Grayson Hansard's NSAttributedString category addition. (Thanks, Grayson!)
